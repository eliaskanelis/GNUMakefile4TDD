### GNU Makefile project for cross-compile and TDD in C

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TediCreations/GNUMakefile4TDD.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/TediCreations/GNUMakefile4TDD)

*SOS: Someone please help me set Travis CI correctly...*

### Description

> GNU Make makefile for cross-compile and Test driven development in C for
> dual-targeted environments

Uses the **STM32F072RB** micro-controller from ST but it can adapt to any
embedded platform.

### WARNING

I designed a better makefile based build system and in the next weeks/months it will be integrated here.
This means that the current functionality will change after the update happens.

Hint: The main change will be the use of python scripts to abstract tools such as linting, flashing, etc from the main functionality of the build system that is to compile and link.

### Goals

All of these are satisfied but need improvement.

1. ~~Test driven development (cppUtest)~~
2. ~~Multi-architecture Build (GNU/Linux & micro-controller)~~
3. Lint (pc-lint)
4. Documentation generation (doxygen)
5. Flash, erase etc. micro-controller
6. Debugging (gdb or other)
7. Auto versioning( git or other )
8. Color output
9. Support C/C++ and assembly.
10. Auto-dependency in build rules.
