# This Makefile enables the automatic generation of macro definition
# headers, --i options and size options for Lint based on command-line
# switches passed to GCC.
#
# Usage:
#
# 	make -f co-gcc.mak \
# 		GCC_BIN='name of the gcc binary' \
# 		GXX_BIN='name of the g++ binary' \
# 		CFLAGS='[usual C compile switches here]' \
# 		CXXFLAGS='[usual C++ compile switches here]' \
# 		CPPFLAGS='[usual common preprocessor switches here]' \
# 		COMMON_FLAGS='[usual C & C++ compile switches here]' \
#
# ... where 'make' is the name of the GNU Make program on your system.
# That invocation should generate the following files:
#
#       lint_cmac.h
#       lint_cppmac.h
#       gcc-include-path.lnt
#       size-options.lnt
#
# Note, if you do not supply the options that you actually compile with,
# you may see undesired results.  Examples:
#
# 1) If you usually compile with -m64 but do not pass this in the
# COMMON_FLAGS variable when you run `make -f co-gcc.mak` then Lint may
# see the wrong size options (so it may think e.g. that sizeof(void*) is
# 4, which of course is inappropriate if you compile your code in 64-bit
# mode).
#
# 2) The set of compile switches (even non-preprocessor switches like -O3)
# can affect the configuration of GCC's preprocessor, which means it can
# affect how the preprocessor views the contents of system headers (and
# hence the token sequence it generates).  So if we don't see the right
# set of compile switches here then the program you Lint might not be the
# program you compile (even though the same .c and .cpp files are
# involved).
#
# See also the file gcc-readme.txt (supplied with the Lint distribution).

	@# Note, we deliberately use '--i' instead of '-i' here; the effect
	@# is that the directories named with the double-dash form are
	@# searched after directories named with the single-dash form.
	@# (See also the entry for '--i' in section 5.7 of the Lint
	@# manual.)
	@#
	@# We typically use '--i' when we want to name a system include
	@# directory, which GCC searches only after it searches all
	@# directories named in a '-I' option.  The upshot is that the
	@# correct search order (i.e., project includes before system
	@# includes) is preserved even when double-dash-i options are given
	@# before single-dash-i options.
	@#
	@# Also note, no harm is done if '-I' options are passed to GCC
	@# here:  directories named with '-I' will appear before the
	@# sys-include-dirs in GCC's output, so even though Lint might then
	@# see a project-include directory named with a '--i' option, that
	@# directory will still be searched before the sys-includes because
	@# of the ordering of '--i' options.  (Just make sure you don't use
	@# the double-dash form with project include dirs outside of this
	@# limited & generated sub-sequence of options because this is the
	@# only place where we are certain that project directories always
	@# come before system directories.)


size-options.lnt:
